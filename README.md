# COVID-19 Tracker for India

You can select different states from the dropdown menu. At first when the app opens, it shows the national data and state-wise data can be shown using user interaction.

A big thanks to **Akash Raj** for letting me use his API for this project. Check him out in the links below, he has a great portfolio.

**This project is not in production yet because I intend to modify it in the future.**

You can run the project on your system by cloning this repository and running `npm install` and `npm start`.

> Note: There are some extra packages mentioned in package.json that have not been used in the project. I intend to build on this project in the future, so you can remove them in your build if you want.

**Future Plans and improvements**

- [ ] Add a feature to display nationals stats after selecting a state. (Currently, cant go back to viewing national stats, after selecting a state)

- [ ] Add bar charts for all the states and national stats.
